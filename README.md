<h1>Multi-Tier Cloud Migration with Cost Optimization on AWS</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project outlines a cost-effective strategy for migrating a multi-tier application (presentation, application, database) from an on-premises data center to the AWS cloud. 

<br />Key aspects include:

  - Utilizing appropriate AWS services like EC2, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, and Route 53 for each application tier.
  - Implementing cost-saving measures like Auto Scaling, optimized storage tiers, and data transfer acceleration.
  - Leveraging CloudFront, a Content Delivery Network, to improve user experience and potentially reduce costs associated with serving static content.
  - Following AWS Well-Architected best practices for security, monitoring, and disaster recovery.

This approach ensures a smooth and cost-optimized migration to the AWS cloud, providing scalability, reliability, and improved performance for your application.

<h3>Planning and Assessment:</h3>

- Tier Identification: Start by identifying the different tiers in your application (presentation, application logic, database). This will help determine the most suitable AWS services for each tier.
- Workload Assessment: Analyze your workloads (CPU, memory, storage) to understand resource requirements and potential for scaling.
- Cost Estimation: Use the AWS Pricing Calculator https://calculator.aws/ to estimate potential costs for different service configurations.

<h3>Migration Strategy:</h3>

- Phased Approach: I Considered a phased migration technique to minimize downtime and risk; migrating one tier at a time, starting with the least critical tier.
- Migration Tools: Tools like AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) or AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) for automated and efficient migration of VMs and databases can be used.

<h3>Services:</h3>

- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Provides on-demand compute instances to host migrated application components.
- Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed database service for hosting migrated relational databases.
- Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage service for storing application data, logs, and backups.
- Amazon CloudFront (Content Delivery Network): Delivers static content (images, videos, etc.) with high performance and low latency.
- Amazon Route 53:  DNS service directs traffic to the Application Load Balancer.
- Reserved Instances (RI): Provides discounted pricing for EC2 instances used for predictable workloads.
- Auto Scaling: Automatically scales EC2 instances up or down based on predefined conditions.
- Spot Instances: Provides cost-effective compute capacity for workloads with flexible start and stop times.
- Application Load Balancer: automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets.
- Amazon VPC: Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for a secure and isolated network environment for your application.
- AWS CloudTrail: CloudTrail for logging all API calls made to AWS account, aiding in cost monitoring and security analysis.

<h3>Following Best Practices:</h3>

- Security: security best practices like IAM roles for least privilege access control and Amazon Security Groups for network access control.
- Monitoring and Logging: Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring application performance, resource utilization, and cost metrics.

<h3>Data Flow:</h3>

1. The source database is located on premise. We utilize an EC2 instance with the DMS software installed to extract data from the on-premise database.
2. Extrated database on ec2 instace is now transfered to the target database, which is Amazon RDS.
3. Application components are migrated to EC2 instances, potentially using containerization technologies like Docker.
4. The migrated application communicates with the RDS database using secure connections.
5. The application retrieves and stores data from S3 buckets as needed.
6. User requests are routed through the internet; DNS service(Route 53) directs traffic to CloudFront.
7. Static content is delivered directly from CloudFront edge locations to users for faster access.
8. Amazon CloudFront checks if the requested content is available in its edge caches. If the content is cached, it delivers it directly to the user from the nearest edge location, significantly reducing latency. If the content is not cached, it retrieves it from the origin server through the application load balancer and caches it for future requests.
9. Requests fromt cloudFront distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances running the web server tier.
